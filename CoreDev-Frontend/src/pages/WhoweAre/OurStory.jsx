                                    In the 1980s, we introduced our initial
                                    accounting software called iAccs (Integrated
                                    Accounting System). It started as a
                                    DOS-based application and quickly became a
                                    valuable tool for Cooperatives and Rural
                                    Banks, helping them automate their credit
                                    and savings operations.

                                    As technology evolved and our clients&apos;
                                    needs grew, we continued to develop our
                                    software. In 2013, we launched iAccs 2013,
                                    marking a turning point in our journey. We
                                    transformed from a software provider into a
                                    service-oriented solutions provider and
                                    established coreDev Solutions Inc., which
                                    operates around the clock to serve our
                                    clients.
